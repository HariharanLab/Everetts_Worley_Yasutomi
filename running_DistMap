# This is r code is for generating a virtual disc model using Distmap ( Karaiskos et al., 2017 - https://github.com/rajewsky-lab/distmap) 

# will need a geometry file (supplemental file 4)
# reference expression patterns (supplemental file 5) 
# and single-cell RNA seq data (we used imputed values from ScVI for mapping the cells to the locations). 
# The cells will be mapped to the reference patterns, and then can be used to generate virtual in situ or predicted gene expression patterns.
